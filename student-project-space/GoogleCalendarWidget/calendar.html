<!-- Here's example of iframe code. Students will need to include a calendar widget -->
<!-- If they include this particular code, then it's for my particular test calendar for this project -->
<!-- They can control the width and height fields to accomodate the space they want this iframe displayed from in their layout -->
<!-- I recommend that we require students to create their own calendars so they can include their own events from the Google Calendar administration page and have it dynamically display on their site through the <iframe> -->
